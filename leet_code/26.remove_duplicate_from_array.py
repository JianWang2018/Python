# Given a sorted array, remove the duplicates in place such that each element appear only once and return the new length.
#
# Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this in place with constant memory.
#
# For example,
# Given input array nums = [1,1,2],
#
# Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively. It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the new length.

#key: the array is sorted, so can remove the duplicate value one by one

    # @param a list of integers
    # @return an integer

                newTail += 1
                A[newTail] = A[i]
