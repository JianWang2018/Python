# Given a string s, find the longest palindromic substring in s. You may assume that the maximum length of s is 1000.
#
# Example:
#
# Input: "babad"
#
# Output: "bab"
#
# Note: "aba" is also a valid answer.
# Example:
#
# Input: "cbbd"
#
# Output: "bb"
# key: build a helper to find the palidrome and loop from the first to last, consider odd and even case
