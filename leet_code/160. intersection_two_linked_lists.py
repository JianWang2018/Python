# Write a program to find the node at which the intersection of two singly linked lists begins.
#
#
# For example, the following two linked lists:
#
# A:          a1 → a2
#                    ↘
#                      c1 → c2 → c3
#                    ↗
# B:     b1 → b2 → b3
# begin to intersect at node c1.
#
#
# Notes:
#
# If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return null.
# The linked lists must retain their original structure after the function returns.
# You may assume there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.
# Your code should preferably run in O(n) time and use only O(1) memory.

# key:
# the idea is if you switch head, the possible difference between length would be countered.
# On the second traversal, they either hit or miss.
# if they meet, pa or pb would be the node we are looking for,
# if they didn't meet, they will hit the end at the same iteration, pa == pb == None, return either one of them is the same,None
