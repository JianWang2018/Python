# Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. Do this without extra space.

# Some hints:
# Could negative integers be palindromes? (ie, -1)
#
# If you are thinking of converting the integer to string, note the restriction of using extra space.
#
# You could also try reversing an integer. However, if you have solved the problem "Reverse Integer", you know that the reversed integer might overflow. How would you handle such case?
#
# There is a more generic way of solving this problem.
# key only need to test half length of the string, sue x> sum to verify
